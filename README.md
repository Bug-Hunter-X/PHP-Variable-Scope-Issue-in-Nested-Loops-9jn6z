This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to variable scope within nested loops and conditional statements.  The original code incorrectly calculates a total due to how PHP handles variable re-initialization within the `if` block. The solution provides a corrected version that uses proper scoping to achieve the intended result. This example highlights the importance of understanding PHP's variable scope rules, especially when dealing with complex nested structures.
